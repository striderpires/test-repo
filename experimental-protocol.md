### Western blotting of unconcentrated SNs from BV2 cultures - *Analysis of a particular released protein*

So far I've tested both AF1729 and B-3 on unconcentrated SNs, from both BV2 and hMac SNs, respectively.

*Getting a large blob around 50kDa, even with unconcentrated*

**Will probably need to resort to IP** - *Deglycosylation could be interesting* - try tomorrow

#### IP

Due to MW of the protein - procure heavy chain specific 2&deg antibody from Jackson Labs
